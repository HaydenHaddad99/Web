    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:5px;"> In most cases, Catapult Health's fees are processed through your health plan as a claim for preventive care. Simple for employers. Simple for participants. No deductibles and no copays</p>
    <br/>
    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:5px;"> Catapult Health hires, trains, certifies and employs each and every team member - no contractors are used. Our processes and tools are specially designed to identify and treat the risk factors and conditions plaguing corporate America - diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and metabolic syndrome. And our mobility enables us to work with employee populations ranging from 100 to 100,000+.</p>
